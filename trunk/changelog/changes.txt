 SSROSE Changelog Rev. 16
**************************************************************
[30/12/2013]
=Source=
*Continued coding of CharServer txt source.
*Maximum packet size was set to 20480 byte until we'll need more. Larger packets cause a buffer overflow And stack corruption even with 2012-04-10 client.
Since we'll only add support for clients 2012-04-10 and older for now, it would be nonsense to add support for larger packets right now.
->added Function sock2newfd to store socket data inside socket array
->added Function sAccept to accept incoming connections 
->added Function sClose to close connections
->added Function sSocket to create a new socket
